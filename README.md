==== 
A solver implementation for enumerating all perfect, maximum and maximal matchings in bipartite graphs
----
May 2015

For a bipartite graph G = (V, E), (1) perfect, (2) maximum and (3) maximal matchings are matchings (1) such that all vertices are incident to some matching edges, (2) whose cardinalities are maximum among all matchings, (3) which are contained in no other matching. In this project, two algorithms for enumerating these three types of matchings are implemented using Java.
